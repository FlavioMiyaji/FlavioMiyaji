# :wave: Introdution :octocat:
Hello, how are you? :metal:

Few things about me, my name is FlÃ¡vio Yoshizo Miyaji, I have bachelor degree in Information systems by the University [UNIARA](https://www.uniara.com.br/). I'm recently working from home for the company [SHX Informatica LTDA](http://www.shx.com.br/site/) as a software engineer and currently living in Brazil.

## :briefcase: Iâ€™m currently working on Venda Assistida
I've been working on this project for about two years, as a Full-stack developer where we use a Java REST API with Spring-boot for backend, PostgresSQL for database, and ReactNative for front-end mobile.

## :mortar_board: Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJS, ReactJS, ReactNative and UI/UX Design
I've been studying this stack since November 2019, since then, I created some projects, most of them it's public here in those repositories and a couple of them it's private for commercial purposes.
